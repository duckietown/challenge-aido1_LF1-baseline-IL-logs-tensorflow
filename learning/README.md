## Tensorflow baseline "Solution template" for challenge `aido_LF`

For learn an imitation model you can execute the commands in the Makefile in chronological order.

For ease of use a Makefile is provided to support all steps in using this template.
There are two ways of running the makefile. Using docker and without.
Without docker you will need to have configured the GPU drivers for learning correctly.

# Docker

## Installing nvidia-docker-runtime

Important: For Docker to work you need to specify your CUDA version
and preferred Tensorflow version in the Dockerfile and Makefile!

Type: `make prepare-docker`

This makes sure docker is able to find the nvidia runtime which connects docker to your GPU(s).

## Learning with docker

Type: `make learn-docker`

## Copy to imitation agent folder

Type: `make copy_for_submission`

# Regular/without docker

## Dependencies

Create new virtual environment and install necessary dependencies. In this case we require Python 2.7 to be installed. You may use another Python version however the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` will have to be adjusted.
Note that ROS needs to be installed additionally if you are running this without Docker.
Important: Make sure that your CuDNN version matches the Tensorflow version that will be installed.
To edit/adjust, change the version in the `install-dependencies` command in the Makefile.

Type: `install-dependencies`

## Train CNN and freeze TensorFlow graph

Train CNN using the extracted images and velocities from the logs.
This creates an executable network with minimal size.

Type: `make learn-regular`

## Copy learned and frozen graph to submission folder

Type: `make regular_copy_for_submission`

The saved file will be used for the following submission step and is copied
to the folder `../imitation_agent`.
