## Tensorflow baseline "Solution template" for challenge `aido_LF`

# Submission

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the folder `output` (generated when evaluating locally)
does not exist. If it does exist, evaluation throws an error message. 

We now have a imitation learning Tensorflow model and are ready to test it.

## Testing locally

To test the model locally without submitting, run the following command:

Type: `dts challenges evaluate --challenge aido2-LF-sim-validation`

## Submitting the learned model

To submit the model to the lane following challenge online, run the following command:

Type: `make submit`
