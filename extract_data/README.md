Learning remarks:

For learning you can execute the commands in the Makefile in chronological order.

For ease of use a Makefile is provided to support all steps in using this template.
There are two ways of running the makefile. Using docker and without.
Without docker you will need to have configured the GPU drivers for learning correctly.

# Docker
## Download and extract data

Type: `make extract_data`

## Make extracted data accessible for learning step

Type: `make copy_for_learning`

Type: `make learn-docker`
