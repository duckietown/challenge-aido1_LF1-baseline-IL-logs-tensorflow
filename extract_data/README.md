## Tensorflow baseline "Solution template" for challenge `aido_LF`

## Data extraction

Note: The supported way is to run data extraction is using Docker. We advise having it installed before continuing.

To be able to run imitation learning, we first download and process and number of logs of recorded driving behavior. To select logs whose behavior you would like to imitate, go to: http://logs.duckietown.org/
The logs we are downloading for this baseline are specified in `src/download_logs.py`. Furthermore to save space, the logs are preprocessed to have a certain size and make them gray-scale in `src/extract_data_functions.py`.


To run the extraction pipeline you can execute the commands in the Makefile in chronological order.

For ease of use a Makefile is provided to support all steps in using this template.

# Docker
## Download and extract data

This downloads the `.bag` log files and extracts the important data into `.h5` files.

Type: `make extract_data`

## Make extracted data accessible for learning step

This simply copies over the extracted data to the `../learning` folder.

Type: `make copy_for_learning`
